## Plan on improving the project

Add your ideas here :)
My plans to imprvoe my project would be to add some images to the coffee menu to make it more appealing to a user. Animations for that page may be a little to much but some coffee realted images would be pleasant to the eye. Adding a section or more text about coffee and its ingredients in the menu for users with food allergies.
